## Skills Acquired and Demonstrated


## Module 1 (of 4) Getting Started and Selecting & Retrieving Data with SQL

#### Module Objectives
Distinguish between use of SQL for data science applications and SQL for more common data management operations.
Use an Entity Relationship diagram, describing the data elements, their relationships, and inter-dependencies and determine if the existent data is sufficient to address a business question.
Retrieve one or more columns of data from a table that relates to the research topic.
Identify a subset of data needed from a column or set of columns and write a SQL query to limit to those results.
Create an analysis environment and use INSERT to put data into a table.
Add effective comments in your queries so that you can remember what you're doing, and so others can review your work.

## Module 2 (of 4) Filtering, Sorting and Calculating Data with SQL

#### Module Overview
Compare analytics tool and CPU time performance between a filtered and unfiltered dataset.
Given a dataset analysis requirement, use WHERE, IN, NOT, AND, and OR alone or in combination to filter the dataset.
Determine whether or not to use wildcards in a data filter or search situation.
Use wildcards to search or filter data based on requirements. Use regular expressions for text processing
Use ORDER BY to sort data according to requirements for number of columns in the sort, sort direction, and sort position.
Create common math operation calculated fields and aliases for calculated fields.
Use AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM to profile data.
Summarize data according to one or more criterion using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

#### Module Overview
Retrieve data from multiple tables using subqueries.
Join tables using an Inner Join and table aliases.
Filter a given data set using set theory by joining tables using Natural, Outer, and Self Joins.
Assess the risk versus benefit of using a Cross Join or Cartesian Join on a set of data.

Use Case / When statements to recode a set of data for grouping at a different level (e.g. cities to regions).
Use Views to simplify SQL operations.
Identify organizational, governance, business, and data conditions that indicate use of a join to prepare data for analysis.
Recite and implement the 3 rules for changing an analysis question into a SQL statement.
